# tanner crab assessment 

The southeast alaska tanner crab asssessment is performed on both the red king crab and the tanner crab survey areas. Analysis is different for each of these surveys, so instructions should be followed for each.

# red king crab survey areas
Tanner crab are assessed from the red king crab survey areas as a non-target or undesigned survey. Therefore the CPUE for crab calculated from these areas is not weighted or stratified (unlike the directed survey which is density stratified). Therefore the red crab survey areas are processed together as one group (so you need to group by area).

## north juneau and stephens passage
Come from data from the Juneau leg of the red king crab survey. These pots need to be seperated into strata for Stephens Passage - using GIS (need to move instructions in here - currently in OneNote).
