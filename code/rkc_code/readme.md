# red king crab assessment 

The southeast alaska red king crab crab asssessment is performed on the red king crab survey areas. 
Analysis is done for each area seperate, partly due to survey data being available at different times and due to each area being a seperate stock.

Need file in data portion of this file, also need to create results folder (results/rkc/cur_yr)


## Juneau area 
Performed in mid-July. This area is done as it's own memo to inform a summer personal use fishery opening in 11-A. 


### Juneau personal use
Harvest is calculated in 'personal_use.R' - see output from OceanAK, at this time you still need 2 calls from data - one with harvest "no of crab" and one that gives "permit returned status designation"
