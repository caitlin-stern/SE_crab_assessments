## Autocorrelation 
The equilbrium harvest rate analysis that has been performed previously (2011, 2018) did not explore the strong autocorrelation issues in the residuals from this regression in the Juneau area. This relationship was acknowledged last year but not explored. This year is was preliminarily explored to assist with setting the appropriate harvest rate for the Juneau area. Further exploration of the best parameterization of this predictive model for the Juneau area is needed and preliminary exploration of this potential issue with the other RKC areas should also be addressed.

This preliminary analysis acknowledges the AR1 relationship and uses two methods in an attempt to correct/ model this relationship to allow for the linear regression to be used in a more predictive manner. Further work is needed to explore additional model parmeterization (i.e. gam, ARIMA, etc.) that may be better suited to assist in determining the most appropriate harvest rate on an annual basis. 
The two methods explored here are 1) an AR1 model parameterized in the general linear modeling framework and 2) a multivariate linear model that includes Year as a co-variate.

The base linear relationship between the mature population change and associated mature harvest rate is variable

## Method 1: AR1 model, phi term
One method to deal with the autocorrelation of the residuals is to estimate an AR(1) model for the linear regression. This involves estimating a parameter (phi) and estimating the model to account for a lag 1 autoregressive pattern. 
This model does eliminate the correlated residual issues however, as the figure suggests it is fairly similar to the base linear model. To determine an appropriate harvest rate for the Juneau area a range of HR were used to predict a proportion change in the mature population (see below). These predicted values were very similar to those predicted with the base linear model and still don't appear to fully consider the time based  correlations of this data set. Further work is needed to determine if a different parameterization of a time series model (ARIMA) would be more appropriate for the purpose of prediction.
