# Figures for document 

#rkc
Figures in year folder are CONFIDENTIAL because they include all harvest values. Refer to rkc/cur_yr/non_conf for those figures that can be public.

Non-confidential information is from the 'confidential_harvest_2018.csv' since 2017/18 was the last commercial opening.  This file ONLY needs to be updated when the commercial fishery opens again.

Panel figures for each bay - created using function in 'functions.R' - called in each of the bay code files - e.g. Gambier.R - stock assessment figures section

Regional figures are created from 'figure2_tables.R' 

As of 2019 rkc areas that HAVE confidential data (and therefore need non_conf figures):
Excursion
Lynn Sisters
Peril 
Seymour
