# Figures for document 

#rkc
Figures in year folder are CONFIDENTIAL because they include all harvest values. Refer to rkc/cur_yr/non_conf for those figures that can be public.

Non-confidential information is from the 'confidential_harvest_2018.csv' since 2017/18 was the last commercial opening.  This file ONLY needs to be updated when the commercial fishery opens again.
