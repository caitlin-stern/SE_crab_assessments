Southeast Alaska crab assessments; red king crab and Tanner crab currently using CSA method

Both Southeast Alaska species have annual pot surveys that results in a weighted stratified CPUE estimate of 3 length bins.  These are used in a catch-survey-analysis (CSA) model to estimate biomass of mature and legal male crab for each survey area.

## red king crab 
Currently (2019) survey 7 areas: Juneau, Excursion, St.James Bay, Peril Strait, Gambier Bay, Pybus Bay, and Seymour Canal.
Historically other areas have been surveyed.
Data from these surveys is stored in OceanAK.
These data are also used to assess the Tanner crab populations in each of these bays.

## Tanner crab
Currently (2019) survey 4 areas in October: Icy Strait, Glacier Bay, Holkham Bay, and Thomas Bay. 
Data from the red king crab survey areas is also used to assess the Tanner crab populations in those bays.  
Tanner crab regionally consists of 11 areas, 4 Tanner survey areas and 7 rkc survey areas.
